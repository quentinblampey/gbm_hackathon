Contributing
------------

Thank you for considering contributing to the GBM MOSAIC project!
This section provides instructions on how to set up the project locally and how to
contribute to the codebase.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started, you can download the source code from the `Github repository`_ by
cloning it:

You can clone the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:owkin/gbm_mosaic.git

Once you have a copy of the source code, we recommend installing the latest version of
`poetry`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make install-poetry

Next, create a Python environment using your preferred management system (``conda``,
``pip``, ...). If you don't have a preferred system, ``poetry`` will automatically
create a new environment in ``.venv/`` when you run ``make config``. If you're using
your own environment, make sure to activate it. To activate ``poetry``'s environment,
you can run: ``poetry shell``.

To configure ``poetry``, provide it with the credentials for `Owkin's
private Python Package Index`_ by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make config

Once that's done, and if it has not been generated yet, you must generate the
``poetry.lock`` file by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make lock

To install all required dependencies, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make install

.. _Github repository: https://github.com/owkin/gbm-mosaic
.. _poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/
.. _Owkin's private Python Package Index: https://pypi.owkin.com/


Pre-commit
~~~~~~~~~~

You can run all the aforementioned styling checks manually as described.
However, we encourage you to use `pre-commit hooks <https://pre-commit.com/>`_
instead to automatically run ``ruff`` and ``mypy``.
This can be done by running :

.. code-block:: console

    $ pre-commit install

from the root of the ``gbm_mosaic`` repository. Now all of
the styling checks will be run each time you commit changes without your
needing to run each one manually. In addition, using ``pre-commit`` will also
allow you to more easily remain up-to-date with code checks as they evolve.

Note that if needed, you can skip these checks with ``git commit --no-verify``.

If you don’t want to use ``pre-commit`` as part of your workflow, you can
still use it to run its checks with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make pre-commit-checks

without needing to have done ``pre-commit install`` beforehand.


Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~

Before contributing, please make sure to read the Owkin contribution guidelines `here`_.

.. _here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B4YI9wrUDNNZd8kxKLkLIPdS0FB_5Bi2Dkr8jRK8GCQ/edit#heading=h.buy0025am68


To contribute to the GBM MOSAIC project, follow these steps:

    1. Create a new branch for your changes.
    2. Make your changes and commit them with clear commit messages.
    3. Push your changes to your branch.

When opening a pull request, make sure to include a clear description of your changes
and why they are necessary.


Testing
~~~~~~~

The GBM MOSAIC project uses  `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_
for testing. To run the tests, simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test


Make sure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GBM MOSAIC project uses `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_
for documentation. To build the documentation, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make docs

The documentation will be built in the ``docs/_build/`` directory.


New dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If or when you add additional dependencies to your project, you can use ``poetry``
in the following manner:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry add owkin-tilingtoolv2


If you already have a ``requirements.txt`` file with your dependencies, you can inject
them using ``poetry`` with the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cat requirements.txt | xargs poetry add


If your project requires dependencies that can't be installed using pip, make sure to
add the corresponding installation commands to the ``Makefile`` under the
``make install`` section like this:

.. code-block:: Makefile

    install: clean
        conda install <conda-specific-dependency>  # Example of dependency only installed with conda
        curl <bash-specific-dependency> | sh  # Example of dependency only installed with bash
        poetry install

You can also add a library located in a git repository, the minimum information you
need to specify is the location of the repository with the git key, and if necessary
the branch from which the library is to be installed. By default ``poetry`` will revert
to the master branch. You can do using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry add "https://github.com/org/mypackage.git#branch=my_branch"

If you're adding a private Owkin repository, you will have to provide the appropriate
authentication credentials, and add a git authentication step in the Github workflow
configuration ``yaml`` file. It would have to be added right **after** the
**Pypi authentication** step like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: Git authentication
      run: |
        poetry config repositories.git-org-project https://github.com/owkin/histonorm.git
        poetry config http-basic.git-org-project ${{ secrets.GIT_USERNAME $}} ${{ secrets.GIT_TOKEN $}}

Once that is done, you can ask on the `#it-support`_ slack channel for a Github access
token for your specific project, and then add these credentials as secret variables
named ``GIT_USERNAME``, ``GIT_TOKEN``. The procedure for adding these secrets is
detailed in the `data-analysis-project-template README.md`_.

.. _data-analysis-project-template README.md: https://github.com/owkin/data-science-project-template#gitHub-configurations

Useful tip
~~~~~~~~~~

The repository comes with a preconfigured ``Makefile`` encapsulating numerous
useful commands. To check them out, run the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make help
